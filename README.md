# **ENGG4930C Course Project Submission Guideline**

This is an example repository for students who are taking ENGG4930A/B/C to submit their course project here.
**Each team** is required to write a `README.md` file for documenting the structure and purpose of files uploaded
to the repository. Your repository should follows the recommended naming convention.

- `coursecode-projectname-documentation` for documents or multimedia submission
- `coursecode-projectname` for coding projects (optional for teams that do not required coding)

A list of files that should consist of:

### Final Report
